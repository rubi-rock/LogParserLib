                            How to create a UI for Python, we use Qt5.


Qt can build a full application - multi platform by itself - but the parsing was already done with Python
therefore Qt is used only for the UI, not fpr the logic. This also allow to change the parsing code easily without
an IDE and without compilation.

To do it, just convert the UI file product with Qt creator (or Qt Designer) to a Python file:
        $ pyuic5 -x mainwindow.ui -o LogParser.py

Then branch the code (event or slots) created in python to drive the user interface built with Qt that has been
converted to Python. Refer to PyQt documentation to do it.

Note that it is require to install:
	. Python 3 - that the version of the parser :
	. Qt5 full package that's the version of the user interface creator
	. PyQt5 to let Python interface with Qt framework

For OSX users, it's a bit more complex - I assume - than for windows user to install it. Here is the receipe I used:

    Download

        . Python 3+
        . XCode 5.1.1+ plus XCode command line tool
        . Qt5 Package - includes the QT Creator or disigner application
        . Qt libraries 5.2.1
        . SIP 4.15.5
        . PyQt 5.2.1

    installation

    	. Python3 : download and install the regular version - there is a .dmg available, you can also use brew:
	        $ brew install python3
        . install xcode
        . install the Command Line Tools:
            $ xcode-select --install
    	. Install Qt5 : the full package is available at http://www.qt.io/download
        . install Qt libraries (qt-opensource-mac-x64-clang-5.2.1.dmg)
        . install python 3.4+
        . unzip and compile SIP source code file
            From the unzipped folder
                python3 configure.py
                make
                sudo make install
                sudo make clean

        . unzip and compile SIP and PyQt
            $ python3 configure.py --qmake ~/Qt5.2.1/5.2.1/clang_64/bin/qmake
            $ make
            $ sudo make install
            $ sudo make clean
            $ python3 -c "import PyQt5"

            Here it is very important to indicate --with-python3 because OSX uses python 2.6 or 2.7 by default at this time and
            it is very risky to set the default Python interpreter to version 3 by default because it could create issues for
            modules using python natively in OSX.

        . Install PyQt5:
            $ brew install PyQt5 --with-python3

            Here it is very important to indicate --with-python3 because OSX uses python 2.6 or 2.7 by default at this
            time and it is very risky to set the default Python interpreter to version 3 by default because it could
            create issues for modules using python natively in OSX.

        . Build PyQt5 labrary manually - yes also because it will install the tool - that's fine - but part of the
          library won't be available from python3:
            - download the source from the web, unzip it
            - build and install PyQt5 from the folder where you unzipped the source
                $ python3 configure.py --qmake /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/qmake
                $ make
                $ make install

          Here it is important to do it with python3, also because this is not the default python version then you must
          specify where is qt5 installed, the qmake is under Qt5/bin. This was my path, you can find it like this:
                $ cd /usr/local/opt/qt5/$VERSION_OF_QT/bin/
                $ pwd
                    /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin
